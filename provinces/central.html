It is in the Matale District of Central Sri Lanka and lies between the towns of Dambulla and Habarane at the height of 370 meters. It consists of a citadel and has ruins of palaces, the Lion Gate, gardens, moats, the Mirror Wall, and many beautiful frescoes (paintings made in wet plaster on walls).
